## AI Engineer @ AdTech | MS Cybersecurity @ NYU | Building tools that help people leverage AI

I build AI-powered tools that solve real problems. My approach: **research deeply, identify gaps, build solutions before anyone asks.**

This strategy landed me interviews at Amazon, Microsoft, SpaceX, FanDuel, and my current AI Engineer role—where I showed up with a [working prototype](https://slackbot-puce.vercel.app) before we ever spoke.

**My north star:** Positively impact one million lives by helping people discover AI as a force multiplier.

### What I'm Building

#### [Campaign Insights Bot](https://slackbot-puce.vercel.app) — The project that landed my job
Built an AI-powered Slack alert system for AdTech campaign monitoring *before* interviewing. Features real-time anomaly detection (Z-score), GPT-generated insights, and closed-loop feedback.

> "I researched the company's gaps, predicted what they needed, and built it. I showed up with a working solution, not just answers."

**Stack:** React, Recharts, OpenAI GPT, Tailwind CSS

#### [Interview Project Generator](https://personal-portfolio-five-taupe.vercel.app) — Try my approach
Paste any job posting → Get AI-generated project ideas that will help you stand out. The same strategy I used, productized for you.

**Stack:** Next.js, Google Gemini API, Tailwind CSS

#### Phishing Detection System — Best Challenge Award @ CSAW
CNN-based phishing detection with GPT-3 chatbot for CSAW cybersecurity competition. 300+ participants, recognized for innovation.

**Stack:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, Docker, GPT-3

#### Roomies — Co-founder
Mobile app for roommate coordination with AI-powered task management and consensus-driven decision making.

**Stack:** React Native, Firebase, AI/ML
